# Data-Driven Materials Optimization

Data-driven predictive modeling and regression-based optimization 
using experimental materials and nanocomposites data.

## Motivation

This project demonstrates how experimental materials data can be 
leveraged using data-driven modeling and machine learning techniques 
to predict properties and optimize material formulations.

The goal is to bridge experimental materials science with 
applied data science and predictive modeling.

## Dataset

- Experimental dataset inspired by published nanocomposite studies
- Number of samples: ~30
- Features: processing parameters and material composition variables
- Target variables: mechanical and material performance metrics

Note: The dataset used here is anonymized and simplified and does not 
contain confidential or proprietary experimental data.

## Methods

- Data preprocessing and feature scaling (standardization / min-max)
- Linear regression and interaction models
- Regularized regression (Lasso)
- Model evaluation using R², adjusted R², and RMSE
- Statistical significance analysis of model coefficients

## Results

- High predictive performance achieved on experimental datasets
- Identification of dominant features affecting material performance
- Lasso regression enabled feature selection and model simplification
- Interaction terms revealed nonlinear relationships between variables

## Relation to Research

This project is inspired by methodologies used in peer-reviewed 
research on data-driven optimization of nanocomposites.

The implementation here is simplified and adapted for demonstration 
purposes in an applied data science context.
